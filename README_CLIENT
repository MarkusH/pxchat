Description of the Splash Screen
================================

The Splash Screen can be used to choose the best settings for your monitor.

First you should adjust the contrast of your monitor so that you see four rows
and four columns in the lower right part. Than you need to change the
brightness so that the field in the lower right corner nearly disappears and
the upper left corner can be seen clearly. All the fields should display an
increase in brightness and visibility from right to left and from bottom to
top. After the brightness is correctly aligned you can go on to adjust the
color values of your monitor in a way that all the different colors in the left
part are easy to recognize.

The upper right picture is supposed to assist you to decide whether your
display configuration is suitable.
